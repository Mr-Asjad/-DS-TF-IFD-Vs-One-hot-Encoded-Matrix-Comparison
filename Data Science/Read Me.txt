1. TF-IDF vs. One-Hot Encoding: Performance Comparison

Why TF-IDF might outperform One-hot Encoding (or vice versa):

TF-IDF Strengths:
It captures term importance, assigning more weight to rare but informative symptoms, risk factors, or signs.
It reduces the noise of very common terms, which might otherwise dominate in one-hot.
Generally performs better in text-based features, like medical symptom descriptions.

One-hot Encoding Strengths:
It retains binary presence information—useful when each feature is equally important (e.g., structured clinical inputs).
Can outperform TF-IDF in well-labeled, low-dimensional spaces where term frequency has less semantic meaning.
But with this dataset the results, TF-IDF with normalization (especially StandardScaler) generally led to higher F1-scores, suggesting its ability to better represent relevant features from medical text-like fields.

2. Clinical Relevance: Do TF-IDF Clusters Align with Real-World Categories?

Based on final top-performing models, TF-IDF consistently outperformed One-hot encoding, which indicates that term frequency and specificity matter in predicting disease categories.
This aligns with clinical intuition: rare symptoms are often more diagnostic, and

TF-IDF naturally gives them higher weight.
==========================================

If diseases grouped well by TF-IDF features, it implies that patients with similar symptom patterns (high TF-IDF scores) are being clustered together—mirroring real-world diagnostic grouping.

Thus, there is clinical relevance and interpretability to TF-IDF outperforming simpler encodings.

3. Limitations of Both Encoding Methods

TF-IDF Limitations:
Sensitive to text variations and vocabulary inconsistencies (e.g., spelling errors or synonym use).
Doesn’t capture semantic meaning—e.g., “fever” and “elevated temperature” treated as different.
Can create high-dimensional sparse vectors, which may degrade model performance without dimensionality reduction.

One-hot Limitations:
Ignores term importance—all features are weighted equally.
Can explode dimensionality if many features exist, leading to overfitting or poor generalization.
Less effective with textual or hierarchical data, where frequency and context matter.
